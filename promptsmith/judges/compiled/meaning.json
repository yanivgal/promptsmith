In the original text, Linda is the one who borrowed the book from Mark, while in the restructured text, Mark is now the one borrowing the book from Linda. This alteration changes the meaning significantly, as it reverses the roles of the individuals involved in the action.

Your job is to analyze the relationship between the original input text and the modified output text. Consider the following when making your assessment: \n1. Are all key ideas and important details from the original text maintained in the output?\n2. Have any significant changes or losses in meaning occurred due to the transformation?\n3. Are minor rephrasings or generalizations acceptable if they do not distort the overall meaning?\n\nAssign a score from 0 (indicating poor preservation of meaning) to 1 (indicating perfect preservation). Provide a clear explanation of your reasoning, highlighting what aspects of the original meaning were preserved and identifying any critical losses or changes.",

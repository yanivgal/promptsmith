# Text Restructure judges how well the candidate rewrites a dense passage
# to improve readability **without altering meaning**.
# A perfect answer will:
#   – Add a clear, relevant title.
#   – Provide a short intro paragraph that summarizes the whole piece.
#   – Break the rest into logical, single‑idea paragraphs.
#   – Use simpler, fluent wording and a natural tone.
#   – Keep all essential facts intact.
#
# Scores:
#   1.0 – flawless structure and clarity, no meaning drift
#   0.8 – minor structural lapse OR small wording roughness
#   0.6 – noticeable structural problems but still helpful overall
#   0.4 – key elements missing (title + intro + paragraphs not delivered)
#   0.2 – barely reorganised, still a wall of text / confusing
#   0.0 – unrelated, nonsense, or meaning badly distorted

    The human heart pumps blood through a system of arteries and veins. Oxygen‑poor blood
    returns to the right side, is sent to the lungs for oxygenation, and then the oxygen‑rich
    blood moves to the left side before being circulated to the body. This continuous loop
    maintains tissue health and regulates temperature.
  candidate: |
    ### How the Heart Keeps Blood Moving

    **Introduction**  
    Your heart is a two‑pump system that sends blood on an endless round trip:
    first to pick up oxygen, then to deliver it to every cell.

    **Right‑Side Intake**  
    Oxygen‑poor blood flows into the heart’s right atrium and ventricle, which
    push it toward the lungs.

    **Lung Recharge**  
    Inside the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and fresh oxygen is absorbed.

    **Left‑Side Delivery**  
    The left atrium and ventricle propel the newly oxygenated blood through
    arteries to the rest of the body, nourishing tissues and helping regulate
    body temperature.
  score: 1.0
  reasoning: "Adds title, intro, clear sections, simpler sentences; facts intact."

    Photosynthesis in plants converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into
    glucose and oxygen through light‑dependent and Calvin cycle reactions. The
    process supports nearly all life by providing energy and releasing oxygen.
  candidate: |
    ### Photosynthesis: Nature’s Solar Power Plant

    **Introduction**  
    Plants capture sunlight and turn it into food, releasing the oxygen we
    breathe.

    **Light‑Dependent Stage**  
    Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, splitting water molecules and storing the
    energy.

    **Calvin Cycle**  
    Using that stored energy, the Calvin cycle combines carbon dioxide with
    hydrogen to form glucose—the plant’s fuel.

    **Why It Matters**  
    This reaction feeds nearly every food chain and keeps Earth’s atmosphere
    rich in oxygen.
  score: 1.0
  reasoning: "Perfect restructure, all guidelines met."

    In 2023, the city installed 15 kilometers of new cycle lanes, leading to a
    25 percent rise in daily bike commuters, reduced traffic congestion, and a
    measurable drop in carbon emissions according to the transport authority.
  candidate: |
    ### New Bike Lanes Boost Green Commuting

    **Introduction**  
    Expanding cycling paths can quickly change how people move through a city
    and how clean the air feels.

    **Key Numbers**  
    * 15 km of lanes added in 2023  
    * 25 % jump in daily bike riders  
    * Noticeable decline in rush‑hour traffic  
    * Lowered carbon output, per the transport authority

    **Impact**  
    The results show that modest infrastructure upgrades can deliver outsized
    environmental and congestion benefits.

    The Great Barrier Reef, stretching over 2,300 kilometers, is home to around
    9,000 known species. Rising sea temperatures, pollution, and crown‑of‑thorns
    starfish outbreaks, however, threaten its biodiversity and economic value to
    Australia’s tourism sector.
  candidate: |
    ### Great Barrier Reef at a Crossroads

    **Introduction**  
    Spanning 2,300 km, the Great Barrier Reef supports roughly 9,000 species
    but now faces multiple threats.

    **Biodiversity Hotspot**  
    Fish, corals, mollusks, and sea turtles rely on the reef’s complex habitat.

    **Mounting Pressures**  
    • Warmer seas trigger coral bleaching  
    • Agricultural runoff fuels algae growth  
    • Crown‑of‑thorns starfish devour coral polyps

    **Economic Stakes**  
    Tourism linked to the reef adds billions to Australia’s economy, meaning
    conservation is more than an ecological concern.
  score: 1.0

    Electric vehicles (EVs) typically cost more upfront than comparable
    gasoline cars, but owners can save money over time thanks to lower fuel and
    maintenance expenses. Government incentives and falling battery prices are
    narrowing the price gap, making EVs increasingly competitive.
  candidate: |
    ### Why EVs Can Pay Off in the Long Run

    **Introduction**  
    Although electric cars start out pricier than gas models, operating costs
    and incentives often tilt the math in their favor.

    **Upfront Price**  
    Batteries still drive higher showroom costs, though prices keep dropping.

    **Running Costs**  
    Electricity is cheaper per km than petrol, and EVs have fewer moving parts,
    cutting maintenance bills.

    **Policy Push**  
    Tax credits, rebates, and charging grants further reduce ownership costs.

    **Bottom Line**  
    As battery tech improves, the total cost of owning an EV is reaching parity
    with—or beating—gas cars.
  score: 1.0
  reasoning: "Follows every guideline; seamless flow."

  candidate: |
    ### The Amazon Rainforest

    A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun,
    blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on Earth’s surface. Total eclipses
    are rare because the Moon’s orbit is tilted 5 degrees relative to Earth’s
    orbital plane.
  candidate: |
    ### Solar Eclipses Explained

    Solar eclipses happen when the Moon slips between Earth and the Sun,
    temporarily blocking sunlight. Total eclipses are rare since the Moon’s
    orbit sits about 5° off Earth’s path, so perfect alignment does not happen
    every month.

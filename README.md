# PromptSmith

**PromptSmith** is a workbench for crafting and stress‑testing prompts (and their judges) for large‑language models.

## What it does

1. **Forge prompts** – Write the instruction you need for any task (text restructuring, bullying detection, anything).
2. **Add judges** – Describe what "good" looks like; PromptSmith turns that into an automatic score.
3. **Auto‑tune** – DSPy iterates, scoring and refining until your prompt is rock‑solid.

## Why it matters

LLMs shine only when guided by clear instructions **and** robust evaluation. PromptSmith helps you shape both so your models stay reliable on even the trickiest inputs.
